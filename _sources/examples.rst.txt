Examples
===========

Setup 
------------

The examples here assume that you have compiled and installed slsDetectorPackage
to ~/sls/install and that the option for SLS_USE_SIMULATOR was enabled. This also builds
the virtual detector servers that we will be using for testing. 

We also add ~/sls/detector/install/bin to the path for convenience. 

Compile examples
-------------------

The source code of the examples is available at:
https://github.com/slsdetectorgroup/api-examples


.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/slsdetectorgroup/api-examples.git
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ../api-examples -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/sls/detector/install
    make


Running a config file [e1]
-----------------------------


.. code-block:: cpp

    #include "Detector.h"
    ...
    sls::Detector det;
    det.loadConfig("path/to/config/file.config");



To configure the connection between PC and detector the easiest 
is to run a config file. For this example we first launch a virtual Jungfrau server and
then set up the detector. 

**Launch a virtual detector server**

.. code-block:: bash

    jungfrauDetectorServer_virtual

This launches a virtual Jungfrau detector server. As default is uses port 1952 and 1953
for communication over TCP. Most commands go on 1952 and only stop and status on 1953. 

**Run example to configure**

.. code-block:: bash
